<h2>Movie maker&#39;s intent with regards to computing</h2>

<h2>Freedom of Speech</h2>
<p>
The way that computing technologies are used, and importantly, not used in relation to the Freedom of Speech in <i>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i> is a major in-universe motivation for the characters' actions.
</p>
<p>
	Freedom of speech, as defined by in US Constitution [TODO: Cite] mostly relates to the government preventing citizens sharing political views or facts that aren't popular with the government at the time, but is a broader protection than that.
</p>
<p>
	In <i>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i>, the major conflict is centers around an illegal blockade and invasion by the Trade Federation on the planet of Naboo. The Trade Federation blocks all communication in and out of Naboo to the point that the Galactic Senate is unsure of if there is any evidence of the invasion.
</p>
<p>
	In <i>Star Wars</i>, there exists both the technology to communicate instantaneously across long distances, and the technology to jam it. The Trade Federation uses this jamming technology to block communication in and out of Naboo in addition to using a droid army and automated ships to prevent citizens of Naboo from leaving to pass on information.
</p>
<p>
	This also brings up the discussion of droids in the Star Wars setting. Most of them are clearly sentient enough to have emotions and capable of speech, but are treated as property. They don't appear to have any rights to legal representation, even in the more lawful regions of space.
</p>
<p>
	In less lawful areas, explosive implants are used to make sure that slaves behave, which is almost certainly used to cause slaves to self-censor.
</p>

  
<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>
  Intellectual Property is a topic never discussed or implied, but can be brought up through the movie's standardization of certain features. Notably, the uniformity of the junky pit droids on Tatooine, along with them being sold at Watto's shop, implies that they are one of three things:
</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Mass-produced by the same organization, which holds a virtual monopoly over the pit droid market in Mos Espa </li>
    <li> Pit droids are under a common license and can be manufactured by anybody for free </li>
    <li> Pit droids are manufactured by multiple companies that infringe upon the intellectual property of the original creator </li>
  </ol>
<p>
  This level of uniformity is unusual in regards to the remainder of the movie, as each significant faction (the Naboo, the Gungans, and the Trade Federation) all possess vastly different technologies with different capabilities (while the Trade Federation has legions of battle droids, the Gungans have an organic, primitive standing army and the Naboo only have a small home defense force.
  This implies either a strict observation of patent rights (assuming patents are filed with the Galactic Senate), or implies that none of the factions felt any need to steal technologies from each other.
</p>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
  <p>The movie doesn't explicitly presents the conflict of privacy issues, but some technologies did imply the privacy concerns behind them.</p>  
  <p>The Faster than Light communication is not only jammable but also traceable. When Naboo planet sent out the message to queen's spaceship asking queen's help, Jedi refused to reply the message because he thought it might be a trap. This scenario indicates the communication is trackable. The transmission of message exposes the senders' position. This violates sender's privacy because if senders don't want to reveal their position, they can use Faster than Light communication anymore.</p>
  <p>Another technology can cause the violation of the privacy is scan. In the movie, there are two kinds of scan: planetary scan, city and building scan. Planetary 3D scan of Tatooine occurred on the spaceship; City 3D scan and building scan occurred when Naboo queue and Jedi were planning to sneak into the Naboo palace. The privacy concerns of scan technology, no matter planetary scan, city scan or building scan, is the proper storage. Any leakages of scan information can lead privacy issues. Citizen's living information can be easily understood and mined with such 3D scan technology.</p>
  <p>The search drone definitely involves privacy issue. In the film, the search drone flew around in the city looking for the queen. The checks of search drone not informing other people violate the privacy of oblivious because their behaviors were secretly watched by search drone and some may involve personal activities.</p>
  <p>Also in the film, Qui-Gon Jinn's behavior went against Anakin's privacy. Using convenient blood check machine, Qui-Gon Jinn tricked Anakin and checked midi-chlorian in Anakin's blood sample. The blood test information is personal. In fact, Anakin never allowed Qui-Gon Jinn to tell other people about his blood test result. However, Qui-Gon Jinn quickly shared the blood information with Jedi Council. Though the blood check machine helps to analyze the blood information if used in a good way, it also increases the risk of uncovering personal information to the public.</p>
  <p>The tracker implanted in slave's body to prevent them from escaping contravenes the privacy privileges of slaves. It is not clear in the film if the implanted tracker will send slave's personal information to the master, but the tracker did work as a monitor 24 hours to trace activity positions of the slaves. </p>
  <p>Though the movie doesn't show a mass surveillance, with such advanced communication and convenient identification technologies, the surveillance is a possible. If a mass surveillance exists in the film, it is most likely in the Republic as it is a well-organized and high-tech constructed planet. Information interchange must be activated in this area, also the potential risk of privacy information leakages. </p>
<h2>Crime</h2>
<p>
  Slavery, blockade and invasion aided by droids, secret communications used for treason and for government corruption leading to a coup.
</p>

<h2>Errors, Failures, and risks</h2>
<p>
  In <i>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i>, reliability of technology is a reoccuring theme. There are numerous technologies that require very few failures (aircar autopilots, hyperdrives, weapons and shield systems), a number of technologies that account for risk and have multiple redundancies and ways to account for equipment malfunctions (pod racers, astromech repair droids on spaceships, Darth Maul's lightsaber), and a few technologies with a single point of failure (the droid control ship above Naboo).
</p>
<p>
  On Coruscant, there is a constant background of aircar traffic, and no collisions are shown onscreen. A single crash could be calamitous - an aircar hitting a skyscraper could potentially bring it down, potentially killing thousands of people. If Coruscant is anything like the real world, then aircars must be incredibly robust and probably have an autopilot.
</p>
<p>
  In the pod racing section of the movie, Anakin (who is 9) pilots the pod racer that he built around the track facing a number of unforseen obstacles, such as being shot at, sabotoge by other competitors, and the obstacles of the track itself.

  His pod, despite being built with very limited resources and having trouble even starting up has a number of fallback systems (on the fly fuel rerouting, for starters) and safety features (the pod racer can prevent itself from crashing when falling from the top of a canyon). 

  One of the other competitors advantage that the announcer comments on is his highly competent repair crew of pit droids. This indicates that building and accounting for failure is a large part of pod races.

  This level of redundancy and the provisions for easy repair indicates that a great deal of thought and effort has gone into accounting for system errors, sabotage, and part failures.
</p>
<p>
  Another place where risk and errors come up in <i>The Phantom Menace</i> is early in the movie - when Queen Amadala's personal spaceship is running the blockade around Naboo.

  Briefly the shields on the ship go down from a stray shot, and repair droids (Astromechs) are sent outside the ship to perform repairs while in flight, where all but one of them are shot off the hull of the ship.

  The implications of this scene aren't immediately clear, but this implies a that diplomatic vessels not only have shields, but carry around enough droids capable of creating a jury-rigged fix for those shields several times over. On the other hand, it shows that the ship doesn't have redundant shields, but overall implies a high level of preparedness for technical failures. There are a number of alternate explanations for there to be so many astromech droids onboard: The droids could be used for other manual tasks, such as cleaning or record keeping, or the number of droids onboard could be a status symbol, or they could have brought onboard a number of droids specifically for this more dangerous mission.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the most poignant example of errors, failures and risks in the movie is the droid control ship in the final sections of the movie.

  In the late stages of the movie, a droid army is invading Naboo, and all the droids are controlled from spaceships that are blockading the planet. A single fighter ship (again, piloted by a 9 year old) lands in one of the docking bays of one of these ships and is capable of destroying the entire ship with a few shots to internal components reachable from the docking bay. The destruction of this ship causes all the droids on the planet to shut down, stopping the invasion in its tracks.

  This is a clearcut example of why redundant systems are important. There were dozens of ships that appear to be the same model as the destroyed ship which could have taken over when this one was destroyed, the ship could almost certainly have been modified to not have a single fairlure point accessible from a point that untrusted ships have access to.

  There is the possibility that the droid shutdown is a safety feature - having thousands of droids with lethal weapons and no easy way to shut them off sounds like a terrible idea, but there are better ways that don't have such an obvious and dramatic single point of failure.
